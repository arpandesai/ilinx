This is the source code for the Janus Technology iOS apps iLinX and iLinX HD
(for iPhone and iPad respectively).  It was last built successfully in 
September 2012, so requires significant changes to bring it up-to-date with
Apple's latest requirements on UI support and API usage.  This effort is
beyond what Janus Technology is able to commit to the product.

It is placed here as open source to allow anyone interested to get involved
in carrying out these updates.  If and when it is back in a suitable state
to be submitted to the App Store, Janus Technology will submit the update
and make the apps live again with the purchase price being set to zero to 
reflect the input from open source developers.

Janus Technology will continue to act as a co-ordinator for any inquiries
about iLinX but can no longer offer any detailed technical support for
this product.

Good luck to those of you who take this on!
